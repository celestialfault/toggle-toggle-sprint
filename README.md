# Toggle Toggle Sprint

[![Requires Fabric API](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/compact/requires/fabric-api_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft adding toggle-sprint/sneak keybinds, making use of the vanilla toggle states in the
Controls menu to ensure that it remains as anti-cheat friendly as possible.  
This also includes a fix for preventing the game from resetting your toggle sprint upon death.

If both [Mod Menu] and [YACL] are installed, this mod also contains a few configuration options that can be modified in-game.

## How is this any different from other mods?

This is primarily designed as a toggle-sprint mod designed for modern versions of Minecraft, using the relevant features
already present in the base game.

Namely, I designed this to replace [Toggle Sneak & Sprint], as instead of simply telling the game that you're
holding the sprint key, it instead simply forces you to always be sprinting *(even when it'd normally be impossible
to do so in vanilla!)*, making it trivially easy to be flagged (and subsequently banned) by a server's anti-cheat.

Instead, as this mod simply reuses the existing Toggle option in the Controls menu, this ensures that it remains
as close to the vanilla sprinting behavior as possible, avoiding anti-cheats getting angry in the process.
