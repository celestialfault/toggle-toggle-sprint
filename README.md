This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft adding toggle-sprint/sneak keybinds, making use of the existing Toggle options
in the Controls menu, ensuring it also remains as anti-cheat friendly as possible.

This also includes a fix for preventing the game from resetting your toggle sprint upon death.

If both [Mod Menu] and [YACL] are installed, this mod also contains a few configuration options that can be modified in-game.

## How is this any different from other mods?

This is primarily designed as a toggle-sprint mod designed for modern versions of Minecraft, using the relevant features
already present in the base game.

Namely, I designed this to replace [Toggle Sneak & Sprint], as instead of simply telling the game that you're
holding the sprint key, it instead simply forces you to always be sprinting *(even when it'd normally be impossible
to do so in vanilla!)*, making it trivially easy to be flagged (and subsequently banned) by a server's anti-cheat.

Instead, as this mod simply reuses the existing Toggle option in the Controls menu, this ensures that it remains
as close to the vanilla sprinting behavior as possible, avoiding anti-cheats getting angry in the process.

## Modpacks?

Go for it. I'd prefer that the download remains within the Modrinth ecosystem, but as this mod is licensed under [CC-0],
you're free to redistribute it however you see fit (but I'd still appreciate credit where possible).
