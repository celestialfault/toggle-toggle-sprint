# Toggle Toggle Sneak

This is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that allows for toggling sprinting and sneaking with keybinds in an anti-cheat friendly way,
by simply modifying the existing vanilla toggle-sneak/sprint options.

This also includes a "fix" for MC-263293, preventing the game from resetting your sprint upon death; this only applies to 1.20.1+.

If both [YACL] and [Mod Menu] are installed, this mod contains a few configuration options that can be modified in-game,
including turning off the above keep sprinting after death fix.

## How does this differ from other mods?

This was largely designed to replace [Toggle Sneak & Sprint], as the former's toggle sprint simply makes it so you always
sprint (even when it'd otherwise be impossible to sprint!), making it very trivial to be flagged (and subsequently banned)
by a server's anti-cheat.

This also differs from the multitude of "keep sprinting after death" mods, as this accomplishes the same goal in
as comprehensive a way as possible, while making as few changes in as minimally invasive a way as possible.
