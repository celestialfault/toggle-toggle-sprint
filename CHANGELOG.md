## 1.1 - Unreleased

### Added

- This changelog file
- Added default bindings for the toggle keys using the right-side versions of the default vanilla key, such as Right Shift
  to match the default Left Shift for the Sneak key

### Changed

- Improved behavior around toggling a key off while the vanilla key is still being held
  - In other words: if you toggle sprint off while holding the vanilla sprint key, you will now continue to sprint after
    toggling it off, instead of having to stop holding and then press the vanilla key again
- Changed some configuration menu names and descriptions to better describe the relevant settings

## 1.0 - 2024-01-05
